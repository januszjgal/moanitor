# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use our application.

## Information We Collect

Our app collects minimal information to provide its core functionality:

### Local Storage Data
- Event timestamps
- Event flags (such as "solo" status)
- Event IDs
- User preferences and settings

All data is stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage. We do not collect or transmit any personal information to external servers.

### Automatically Collected Information
When you use our app, the system may automatically provide us with:
- Basic device information (model, operating system version)
- App crash reports and basic usage data through the default system reporting

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information solely to:
- Display your activity history in calendar and list views
- Maintain your event logs
- Allow you to export and import your data
- Improve app stability and performance

## Data Storage and Security

All your data is stored locally on your device. We use React Native's AsyncStorage for data persistence, which means:
- Your data remains on your device
- You can export your data at any time
- You can clear all data through the settings menu
- You can import data from previous exports

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not collect, sell, or share your personal information with any third parties. All data remains locally on your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.

## Export and Import Features

Our app includes features to:
- Export your data as a JSON file
- Import previously exported data
- Share your exported data using your device's native sharing features

You maintain full control over when and how to export or import your data.

## Third-Party Services

Our app uses the following third-party services:
- React Native Calendar (for calendar visualization)
- Expo Framework components
These services do not receive any of your personal data.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access all your data (through the app's built-in export feature)
- Delete all your data (through the settings menu)
- Control your data (through import/export features)
